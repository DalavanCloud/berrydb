/** std::default_delete variant that calls Release on the pointer.
 *
 * All the project's types use a custom memory allocator defined in platform.h.
 * To avoid bugs, their constructors and destructors are marked private.
 * operator new is replaced Create() methods, and operator delete is replaced by
 * Release() methods.
 *
 * This deleter invokes the Release() method, and must be used with smart
 * pointers targeting the project's types. The deleter is stateless, so it adds
 * no memory overhead to smart pointer implementations that take advantage of
 * the empty base optimization.
 *
 * Instead of using this deleter directly with std::unique_ptr, use the
 * UniquePtr alias defined in util/unique_ptr.h.
